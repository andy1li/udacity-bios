# Pirate Fleet 1

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains starter code for the Pirate Fleet 1 project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

Pirate Fleet is a [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) clone with a twist, it has mines! In addition to the basic Battleship gameplay, mines can be placed on the gamefield as an obstacle. If a player hits a mine, then an extra turn is awarded to the opposing player.

## Setup

Pay attention to `ControlCenter.swift`. This is where you should direct your edits and implement functionality related to the project. Otherwise, there are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
