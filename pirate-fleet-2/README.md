# Pirate Fleet 2

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains starter code for the Pirate Fleet 2 project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

Pirate Fleet is a [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) clone with a twist, it has mines and seamonsters! In addition to the basic Battleship gameplay, mines and seamonsters can be placed on the gamefield as obstacles: 
- If a player hits a mine, then an extra turn is awarded to the opposing player.
- If a player hits a seamonster, then the opposing player is awarded a free hit on any of the offending player's ships.

## Setup

Pay attention to `ControlCenter.swift`. This is where you should direct your edits and implement functionality related to the project. Otherwise, there are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
