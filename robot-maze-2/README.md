# Robot Maze 2

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains starter code for the Robot Maze 2 project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

Robot Maze is an iOS application where users direct a robot around a maze and to its final destination. There are multiple versions of Robot Maze, each corresponding to different objectives:

- Robot-Maze-2-Part-1/
- Robot-Maze-2-Part-2/
- Robot-Maze-2-Part-3/

## Setup

The main logic for the robot is in `ControlCenter.swift`. This is where you should direct your edits and implement functionality for the robot. Otherwise, there are no special setup instructions, just build and run!
